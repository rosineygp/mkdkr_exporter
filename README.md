Export Makefile to following pipeline engines:

- circle-ci
- github actions
- gitlab-ci
- jenkins (dsl pipeline)
- travis
- bitbucket-pipelines ยน

> ยน privileged containers not working at bitbucket cloud

All Makefile user targets is added, including implicit jobs (like [commitlint](https://github.com/rosineygp/mkdkr_commitlint)).

Additional environment variables, flows and error handling needs to be implemented by user.

> This project pipeline is made using [mkdkr_exporter](https://github.com/rosineygp/mkdkr_exporter).

# usage

## include

Add the following line at mkdkr.csv

```csv
exporter,https://github.com/rosineygp/mkdkr_exporter.git
```
## execute

No needs aditional step in your Makefile (implicit)

```bash
# export to gitlab
make _exporter_gitlab-ci

# export to github actions
make _exporter_github

# export to travis
make _exporter_travis

# export to circle ci
make _exporter_circle-ci

# export to jenkins (pipeline syntax)
make _exporter_jenkins_pipeline

# export to bitbucket pipelines
make _exporter_bitbucket-pipelines
```

## how it works

The script will read `Makefile` and execute `make -qp`. It will return all explicit and implicit make targets.

For better result add and prefix in your Makefile target name like this.

```Makefile
lint.python:
  ...

test.unit:
  ...

test.dast:
  ...

deploy.heroku:
  ...
```

or using slash as separator.

```Makefile
lint/python:
  ...

test/unit:
  ...

test/dast:
  ...

deploy/heroku:
  ...
```
The prefix will be used as job **stage** and run in parallel at **gitlab-ci** and **travis**.

If not added prefix, the stage name will be the same as target name.

## exclude targets

To exclude a target in exporter generator the first letter of target name needs to be different of following regex **[a-zA-Z]**.

> \* suggest start with **_** underscore.
